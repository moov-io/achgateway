# Overview

Moov’s mission is to give developers an easy way to create and integrate bank processing into their own software products. Our open source projects are each focused on solving a single responsibility in financial services and designed around performance, scalability, and ease of use.

ACHGateway is an extensible, highly-available, distributed, and fault-tolerant Nacha ACH uploader and downloader. ACHGateway creates events for outside services and transforms files prior to upload to fit real-world requirements of production systems. For an introduction to ACH [refer to our guide](https://moov-io.github.io/ach/intro/).

Payment systems need to be adaptable for all kinds of uses and this is the primary goal of ACHGateway. Typically businesses submit ACH files (in their Nacha format) to initiate debits/credits against bank accounts. An Originating Depository Financial Institution (ODFI) can be your legal and financial partner. ACHGateway can optimize and streamline the integration to your ODFI.
